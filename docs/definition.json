This is because the receptive field of the motion sensor is limited in size, and thus can only detect motion in one direction.", "apparent motion": "Apparent motion is a visual illusion in which a series of static images appear to be moving. It is created by the brain's ability to interpolate between intermittent views of a moving object, and is used to track and predict the object's position through time.

The display contains two kinds of features: the terminators of each line and the intersection of the two lines. When the lines are viewed behind visible occluders, they appear to move together as a welded unit in the upward direction. When the occluders are made invisible, the lines no longer cohere and appear to slide one on top of the other in opposite directions. The chopsticks illusion not only depends upon how feature tracking signals are altered by visible and invisible occluders, but also upon how the form system disambiguates the ambiguous region where the two chopsticks intersect and uses figure-ground mechanisms to separate them in depth.", "direction-of-motion": "Direction-of-motion refers to the direction in which an object is moving, as perceived by an observer. \n\nIn this book, the term is used to describe the estimation of motion direction and speed, as well as the capture of direction and speed of motion, and the separation of form and motion streams.", "noise-saturation dilemma": "The noise-saturation dilemma is a thought experiment used to explore the balance between cooperation and competition in pattern processing and the effects of brightness constancy and contrast.

It is a form of mismatch learning in which a difference vector is used as an error signal to adjust the weights of the system until the difference vector is zero.", "match tracking": "Match tracking is a patented process used in artificial neural networks to achieve minimax learning, whereby the minimum amount of memory is used to adequately predict the outcome in any given situation. Match tracking works by increasing the vigilance parameter just enough to trigger a memory search for a better-matching category in response to a predictive error. This allows the network to learn the most general recognition categories while conserving memory resources.", "Motor Theory of Speech Perception": "The Motor Theory of Speech Perception is a theory which proposes that people perceive spoken words by recognizing the motor commands that produce them, rather than by recognizing the sound patterns they generate.

It is typically measured by subtracting reaction time (RT) for searching a familiar scene from the RT for searching a novel scene. Object contextual cueing is typically studied using psychological experiments, and has inspired the development of many visual search models.", "opponent extinction": "Opponent extinction is a process in which counter-conditioning an OFF channel using antagonistic rebounds can use opponent competition and back-propagating dendritic spikes to force forgetting of ON channel contingencies that are no longer relevant. This process is used to prevent LTM saturation and to normalize net activities in which the smaller activity is inhibited to zero and the larger activity is sensitive to the ratio of the inputs. It is also used to inhibit motivation for action and expectations of any no-shock place to which to escape, as seen in learned helplessness.", "opponent processes": "Opponent processes are brain circuits wherein positive and negative emotional centers interact together, activating mutually exclusive pathways that compete with one another. Opponent processes are designed to enable antagonistic rebounds to occur, allowing for adaptive responses to changing environments.", "overshadowing": "Overshadowing is a phenomenon in classical conditioning where prior learning of one stimulus (CS1) prevents learning of another stimulus (CS2) even when the two stimuli are presented simultaneously.

This mismatch can be corrected by activating a nonspecific arousal response, which serves as an error-correcting event.", "timing paradox": "Timing paradox is a phenomenon in which inhibition of orienting responses is spread throughout a time interval, while adaptively timed responses are triggered at the end of the interval. This phenomenon is solved by the Weber law, which creates an adaptively timed response throughout the time interval that peaks at the end of the interval.", "Theory of Mind": "Theory of Mind is a cognitive capacity that enables an individual to understand the mental states of other people, such as their beliefs, desires, and intentions. It is a key component of social cognition and is essential for successful social interaction. In the book, Theory of Mind is used to explain the breakdowns in mental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, which are characterized by deficits in social functioning. The book suggests that these deficits are caused by hypoactivity of the amygdala or orbitofrontal cortex, which prevents cognitive-emotional resonance from occurring and leads to failures in Theory of Mind processes."}
