The model includes a spectral timing circuit that uses a population of cells with differently timed responses to inhibit spurious orienting responses throughout its adaptively timed interval, and to maintain motivated attention upon learned response with maximal probability at the expected time of occurrence of the reward. The model has been extended to the nSTART model, which explains the link between conditioning and consciousness by embedding the CogEM model into a larger learning circuit that includes the hippocampus.", "SyNAPSE": "SyNAPSE (Systems of Neuromorphic Adaptive Plastic Scalable Electronics) is a DARPA program that seeks to understand how laminar neocortical circuits control various forms of intelligence such as vision, speech, and cognition.

The GO signal G multiplies the difference vector D to form the product DG[]+ which is integrated by P, changing G changes the rate at which P approaches T, and thus the velocity of movement. The model is able to explain how a simple reaching movement by an arm can be carried out in an approximately straight movement trajectory through space.", "Principle of Sufficient Reason": "The Principle of Sufficient Reason is a philosophical concept which states that for any event or action, there must be a sufficient cause or reason for it to occur. In the context of the book, the Principle of Sufficient Reason is used to explain how a coding error can be corrected without any individual cell knowing that an error has occurred.

They are often seen as orientational afterimages, such as the MacKay illusion, which is a circular form that appears perpendicular to the radial lines of an image after it has been removed. Residual traces are used in perceptual studies to measure how long it takes for a percept to disappear after the image has been removed.", "SACCART": "SACCART (Superior Colliculus Category-Learning and Attentional Regulation Theory) is a model developed by Grossberg et al. (1997) which proposes how the superior colliculus (SC) movement map is learned as part of a motor category learning process, and how this learning is dynamically stabilized by a top-down attentional feedback circuit that obeys the ART Matching Rule.

These list chunks can then be motivationally amplified or suppressed via reinforcement learning.", "spatial impenetrability": "Spatial impenetrability is the property of objects in a scene that prevents them from penetrating each other. This property is used to explain why certain boundary groupings do not form in a scene, such as when the boundaries of an object occlude the boundaries of other objects in a scene. Spatial impenetrability is also used to explain why T-junctions can successfully trigger figure-ground separation, and why certain objects appear to lie in front of other objects.", "figure-ground": "Figure-ground is a term used to describe the process of perceiving an object as distinct from its background. It is a Gestalt principle that states that when looking at a complex visual scene, the eye will separate the object from its background and perceive it as a distinct figure.
