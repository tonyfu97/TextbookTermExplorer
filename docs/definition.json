{"ART": "Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) is a cognitive and neural theory developed by Stephen Grossberg in 1976 that explains how our brains learn to attend, recognize, and predict objects and events in a changing world. It is based on the concept of adaptive resonance, which is a consensus between what is out there in the world and what we expect to see based on our past experiences. ART is used in two forms: as algorithms for large-scale engineering and technological applications, and as a biological theory. It has been used in many applications, including engineering design retrieval systems, classification and prediction of sonar and radar signals, and control of mobile robots.", "shroud": "A shroud is a piece of cloth or other material used to cover or wrap a person's body for burial.", "anticipatory": "Anticipatory error gradient is a term used to describe the errors made when recalling items from a list, where errors are more likely for items closer to the beginning of the list than those further away.", "Hebbian": "Hebbian learning is a type of learning in which an increase in the strength of a connection between two neurons is associated with an increase in the activity of both neurons. It is based on the idea that neurons that fire together, wire together, and is named after the Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb.", "associative": "Associative is a type of learning in which an association is made between two stimuli, such that the presence of one stimulus leads to the anticipation of the other.

It is used to construct representations of visible features in a scene, such as color contours, feature patterns, and brightness constancy.", "perceptual grouping": "Perceptual grouping is the process by which the brain organizes visual information into meaningful patterns and shapes. It involves the integration of various features of a visual stimulus, such as color, shape, size, and orientation, to form a unified representation of the stimulus. This process is thought to be largely driven by bottom-up processes, such as filtering and perceptual grouping, that act directly on visual scenes and images at early stages of brain processing.", "attentionally blocked": "Attentional blocking is a phenomenon in which a stimulus that is predictively irrelevant is not noticed or processed by the brain.

The conditioned inhibitor does not extinguish, or weaken, when the CS is presented without the reward or punishment, unlike conditioned excitators which do extinguish. This type of learning is often used to explain why certain emotional memories persist for a long time, while others are more easily forgotten.", "gated steepest descent": "Gated steepest descent learning is a learning law that explains how long-term memory traces track and approach the value of a post-synaptic short-term memory signal through time. Learning only occurs when a pre-synaptic short-term \u201csampling\u201d signal is active enough, and thereby opens a learning \u201cgate\u201d that enables steepest descent to occur.", "expectation": "Expectation is the anticipation of a future event or outcome based on past experience or knowledge. In the context of neuroscience, expectation is the concept of resonance in neural systems, where external input matches already stored knowledge (expectation and attention) to create a dynamical structure that suppresses noise and irrelevant details and enables fast and effective responses. When resonance fails, this triggers adaptation.", "feedforward": "Feedforward is a type of network in which information flows in one direction, from the outside of the system progressively inward. It is distinct from a feedback network, in which interactions occur in both directions, both to and from a given neuron. Feedforward networks are used in computing, neuroscience, and other fields to process and analyze data.", "GRIDSmap": "GRIDSmap is a model developed by Himanshu and Anatoli which uses algorithmically defined stripe cells to process realistic rat trajectories.

It uses variations of the same canonical laminar cortical circuitry as the 3D LAMINART model for vision and the cARTWORD model for speech perception, thereby providing insights into how specialized resonances use similar types of circuits to support different conscious experiences.", "MOTIVATOR": "Motivator is a term used to describe a model of cognitive-emotional interactions that explains how the amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and orbitofrontal cortex interact to make emotionally-modulated decisions. The model is based on the CogEM model and includes a model of how a key process in the basal ganglia works.

It includes simulations of the complex pattern of disruptions of memory consolidation that occur in response to early vs. late lesions of thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, and orbitofrontal cortex.", "aperture problem": "The aperture problem is a phenomenon in which a localized neural motion sensor, such as a neuron in the early visual pathway, is unable to accurately measure the direction and speed of motion when a contour within an aperture does not contain unambiguous features. This is because the receptive field of the motion sensor is limited in size, and thus can only detect motion in one direction.", "apparent motion": "Apparent motion is a visual illusion in which a series of static images appear to be moving. It is created by the brain's ability to interpolate between intermittent views of a moving object, and is used to track and predict the object's position through time. In this context, it is often used to track a predator or prey animal through time when it moves at variable speeds behind intermittent occluders, such as bushes and trees.", "barberpole illusion": "The barberpole illusion is an optical illusion in which a rotating barberpole appears to move in a single direction, even though its local motion signals suggest multiple directions. This illusion is used to explain how the visual system can integrate spatially separated motion signals into a single object motion percept. It is also used to explain how the brain can track an object's direction and speed of motion, even under challenging lighting conditions.", "chopsticks illusion": "The chopsticks illusion is an unambiguous percept of objects moving in depth, where two overlapping diagonal bars of the same luminance (the \u201cchopsticks\u201d) move in opposite directions, to the left or to the right. The display contains two kinds of features: the terminators of each line and the intersection of the two lines. When the lines are viewed behind visible occluders, they appear to move together as a welded unit in the upward direction. When the occluders are made invisible, the lines no longer cohere and appear to slide one on top of the other in opposite directions. The chopsticks illusion not only depends upon how feature tracking signals are altered by visible and invisible occluders, but also upon how the form system disambiguates the ambiguous region where the two chopsticks intersect and uses figure-ground mechanisms to separate them in depth."}
